# Resume
My current resume along with some older copies.

I make my resume using Apple's Pages app for OSX.
I use the Proxima Nova typeface for all of my headings, Helvetica for all of my body text, and Helvetica Neue for my name.
Pages' table feature is how I achieve the mosaic-style layout of my paragraphs - although, in retrospect, having MS Word would have 
probably made all of this dramatically easier.  

If you have any suggestion for enhancements or improvements, drop me an issue or PR.
